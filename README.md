# WB TECH Golang Course

## Description

This repository contains my progress through the WB Tech Golang course, focusing on learning and practicing real-world Go development skills. The course consists of 5 levels (L0-L4), each located in its own directory with detailed descriptions in their READMEs.

## Level Descriptions:

- **L0** – Test task: Orders microservice. Kafka, PostgreSQL, HTTP, caching.
- **L1** – Simple tasks focused on understanding language syntax, without complex logic.
- **L2** – More theoretical questions about Go's internals, explanations of program behavior in specific cases. Coding tasks with more complex logic. Implementing custom existing utilities (grep, cut, sort, etc.).

## Review

Each level is reviewed and graded by WB Tech experts, ensuring practical understanding of Go concepts. More detailed feedback, including comments, is described in every level's README.

Brief description of results:
- **L0**: 5/5 points. Overall a very good solution (some comments in l0 README)
- **L1**: ~4.7/5 points. The solutions and tests are good, but in some places, important comments were missing.
