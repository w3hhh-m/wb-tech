# WB TECH Golang Course

## Description

This repository contains my progress through the WB Tech Golang course, focusing on learning and practicing real-world Go development skills. The course consists of 5 levels (L0-L4), each located in its own directory with detailed descriptions in their READMEs.

## Review

Each level is reviewed and graded by WB Tech experts, ensuring practical understanding of Go concepts. More detailed feedback, including comments, is described in every level's README.

Brief description of results:
- **L0**: 5/5 points. Overall a very good solution (some comments in l0 README)
- **L1**: ~4.7/5 points. The solutions and tests are good, but in some places, important comments were missing.
